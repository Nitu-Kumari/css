# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

# The Difference Between ID and Class
~~~
ID=ID is unique .
Each element can have only one ID
Each page can have only one element with that ID.
CLASS
class are not unique
Use same class on multiple element.
Use multiple class on the same element.

# Width

The width CSS property sets an element's width.
 By default it sets the width of the content area, but if box-sizing is set to border-box, it sets the width of the border area.

 # Height

If present, the preceding <length> or <percentage> is applied to the element's content box.

  Padding corresponds to space between the border and the content. 
  The border wraps around the padding and content, and the margin clears space around the border.
